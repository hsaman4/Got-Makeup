## What does the project do:
You can browse recommended products, as well as, make  wishlist of products by adding the prodcut name and image URL.
## This website was created using the following:
* React-App
* React Router 
* 3rd Party Api 
* Mock Api 

# Using React-App and React Router, I was able to create links to different pages of the website. 
# For the 3rd party api, I used Mapbox to create a store locator map. 
# A mock api was created to use as the content for the site. Also, when the data is put in to the Wishlist, the mock api is updated with the information.
